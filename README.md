# Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne:

This repo gathers my personal work on all assignments from the Coursera course "Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark" from EPFL University: https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data
Every assignment folder contains a README in order to explain quickly what the application does and how to run it locally.
